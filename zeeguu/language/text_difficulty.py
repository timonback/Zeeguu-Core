# This file encapsulates the algorithm for computing the difficulty of
# a given text taking.
#
# The algorithm was extracted from a really impressive single method
# that used to live in the /get_difficulty_for_text endpoint implementation
#
# Original algo implementation was initially written by Linus Schab
